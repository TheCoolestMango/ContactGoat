## 1. Description
During different IT-events it is often impossible for most people to collect information about participants using Google Forms due tot the fact, that the Internet in large open spaces is very weak. Meanwhile, Microsoft Excel is not available for free and using Google Sheets for gathering personal information makes the information vulnurable and visible to other people.

ContactGot is an offline desktop app, where clients can leave their info, while an administrator can manage which information they need to gather on certain projects.

Then in the session window:
* the user inputs the mandatory fields
* includes level of preparation of a participant
* writes additional information if necessary
* either saves the progress, or saves and closes the application
