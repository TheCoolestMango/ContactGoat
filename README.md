Meanwhile, using Google Sheets for gathering personal information makes the information vulnurable and visible to other people.

Features:
* ContactGot is an offline desktop app.
* clients can leave their info.
* administrator can manage which information they need to gather on certain projects.
* administrator can save all data as a local csv file.
